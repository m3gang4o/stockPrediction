# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python  

This project aims to predict stock prices using various **machine learning techniques** in Python. By leveraging **historical stock data**, we analyze trends and make predictions using models like **Linear Regression, LSTM, and Random Forest**.  

## **🔍 Overview**
Stock price prediction is a crucial problem in finance and trading. The objective of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that can forecast stock prices based on historical data.  

The following steps are implemented:  
✔ Data Collection (Fetching stock market data)  
✔ Data Preprocessing (Cleaning and transforming data)  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Feature Engineering  
✔ Model Training & Evaluation
